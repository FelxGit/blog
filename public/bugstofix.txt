Info
1) Do you know that find() used first() behind the scene?
2) The first() also used get() behind the scene but with a limit of 1. Equivalent to (ex. get()->first() )
3) Other than getRouteKeyName() in Route Model Binding, you could also change the primary keys in find() which default is id. That means you could
   {
    public $primaryKey = 'slug';
    ModelName::find($slug);
   }
